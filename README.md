# Quizzin MK3
A silly little quiz app I developed using Godot to host quizzes for my friends.

## Features
- Online hosting system, where hosts control the flow of the quiz for connected peers
- Ability for peers to submit and score their answers
- Image and audio questions
- Pictionary style art rounds where users can draw pictures for others to guess
- Minigame rounds
- 3D Multiplayer first person shooter deathmatch mode
