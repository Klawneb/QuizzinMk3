	"you wouldnt have forgotten would you?",
	"or did you not find it in the first place?",
	"after all that effort I put into it",
	"only for you fuckers to spam right click so much", 
	"it broke the shitty free host I was using",
	"probably, maybe?",
	"I mean that was my excuse as to why some stuff didn't work properly",
	"even though it probably wasn't the reason",
	"but hey, it was convienient",
	"anyways",
	"I hope you aren't expecing as much right click dialogue this time",

	"why did you waste so much time",
	"writing shit tier diaologue for the right click menu that most people",

	"if I'm gonna have a pointless right click thing",
	"with some dialogue",
	"then it has to have a decent amount of it, right?",
	"I didn't even need to implement it for this one",
	"there is not even a right click menu to begin with",
	"it was only on the last one to perhaps counter some tactical googling",
	"*wink* *wink*",
	"but you",
	"you wouldn't google anyway",
	"after all",
	"you made it this far into the right click dialogue",
	"no bad person could make it this far in",
	"right?",
	"that's why you're gonna win this quiz",
	"I believe in you",
	"you got this",
	"a lesser person would have died from cringe at this point",

	"what are you, a fucking cop?",
	"aren't I supposed to be the one asking questions here?",
	"sorry",
	"that was uncalled for",
	"I'm just riffing over here",
	"is the bit wearing thin yet?",
	"are you getting tired of reading right click prompts?",
	"can you believe the right click thing in the other one was only 38 lines long?",
	"and like 8 lines of that were ellipses",
	"that was pretty pathetic",
	"this fucker just keeps on going",
	"although I really am running out of bullshit to type now",
	"any ideas?",
	"nothing?",
	"hmmm",
	"how about a movie?",
	"hey",
	"what the hell",
	"I was watching that",

	"might as well make a start now, eh?"
